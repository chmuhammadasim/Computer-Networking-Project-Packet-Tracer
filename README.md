# Computer Networking Project - Packet Tracer

## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Computer Networking Project" repository! This project was developed using Packet Tracer version 8.2.1, showcasing a comprehensive network setup. The architecture comprises 8 routers, 8 switches, 6 PCs, and various servers, including DHCP, FTP, TFTP, Email, and SYSLOG. The network is secured by a Firewall ASA 5506, managed through a Wireless LAN Controller, and features a printer, tunnel connections, and VTP connections.

## Key Components

- **Router Configuration**: Eight routers have been strategically configured to ensure seamless communication within the network.

- **Switch Network**: With eight switches, the project emphasizes efficient network switching and management.

- **PC Integration**: Six PCs have been integrated into the network, each playing a unique role in the overall system.

- **Server Variety**: Utilizing DHCP, FTP, TFTP, Email server, and SYSLOG, this project simulates real-world server scenarios.

- **Firewall Protection**: The inclusion of ASA 5506 ensures a robust security layer for the entire network.

- **Wireless Connectivity**: Managed through a Wireless LAN Controller, the network embraces modern wireless technologies.

- **Peripheral Devices**: A printer adds a practical touch to the network setup.

- **Specialized Connections**: The project includes tunnel connections to link different networks, VTP connections, and basic configurations to enhance network functionality.

- **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**: Enabled on routers to automate IP address assignment.

- **VLAN InterRouting**: Implementation of VLANs and inter-routing enhances network segmentation and performance.

- **Visualized Network Structure**: The project provides a visual representation of the network setup, aiding in understanding and analysis.
